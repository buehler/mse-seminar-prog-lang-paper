        Type systems play a fundamental role in modern
        programming languages. They provide assistance
        and error handling to the developer before the code
        hits a productive system. They help reduce the errors
        that can occur when two elements of different types
        interact with each other. This paper focuses on
        how one can create and add such a type system to an untyped
        language and create a simple typed language
        with some useful extensions.
