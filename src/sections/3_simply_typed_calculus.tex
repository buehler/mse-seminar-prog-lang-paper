\section{Simply Typed Lambda-Calculus}

Short introduction sentence here.
the following sub sections should describe
the principles of the simply typed lambda calculus.

\begin{itemize}
    \item What are types
    \item What can we do with them
    \item further elements like base types
    \item where is it used (lambda calculus)
\end{itemize}

each section should explain the topic in both ways.
first the "math" way to explain what the topic is and
then, the developer language version.

The goal should be, that a developer can read those sections
and can interpret what the simply typed lambda calculus is. Explained
in terms and examples that a normal experienced developer should understand.
