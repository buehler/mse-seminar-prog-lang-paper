\section{Conclusion}

With the application of simple types to the $\lambda$-Calculus
and the addition of ``simple extensions'', the result of this paper
is a form of the ``simply-typed $\lambda$-Calculus'' with extensions to
the language and the type system to make a practical language. It shows
the additions needed and the steps taken to add a type system to an
untyped language. It gives some insight into the very complex topic
of type systems and how they work and provides explanations for the
various mathematical formulas and derivation trees. It should be
noted that the result is not a fully fledged programming language since
subtyping and polymorphism are still missing which is a big part of
modern languages. The simply-typed $\lambda$-Calculus, however, is
a good example for type-science since it is not too complex and
can be extended quite easily.
